# Material from talk at Develop Excel London 2018

This repo contains the slides and demo materials from the talk "Integrating Excel and Python" given at the
*Develop Excel* conference in London on 18/10/2018.

To try out the code, add the *pyxll.cfg* file in the demos folder to your own pyxll.cfg file as an
external config by adding the path to the *external_config* option in the *PYXLL* section.

The workbooks used are in the demos folder.

Python 3.6 x64 (Miniconda) was used for the demos.
